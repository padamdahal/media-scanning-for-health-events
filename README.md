# media-scanning-for-health-events
This is a prototype app for scanning local online media for health alerts.
App prepares a list of news with title and a link to the source.
It uses a pre-defined list of feed urls and scanning the home pages to detect possible health alert through comparing the pre-listed keywords.

## Cons
* Pretty slow :(
